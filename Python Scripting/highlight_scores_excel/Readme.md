This script reads data from an Excel file (input_data.xlsx), 
checks the "Score" column, and highlights cells with values greater 
than 50. Highlighted cells are formatted with a Reflex Blue background and 
white font. The modified data is saved to a new file 
(output_highlighted.xlsx) using the openpyxl library.
