## Purpose
• To describe the linear relationship between two continuous variables, the response variable (y-axis) and a single predictor variable (x-axis) 

• To determine how much of the variation in Y can be explained by the linear relationship with X and how much of this relationship remains unexplained 

• To predict new values of Y from new values of X
